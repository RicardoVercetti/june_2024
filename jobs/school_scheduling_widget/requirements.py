# requirements.py

# Given the classes that students need to take next year, 
# I use Python to identify how many students need each course 
# and how many sections of the courses. For example, if each 
# classroom accommodates 30 students and 59 need to take the 
# course then we need 2 sections of the class (For example:  
# 	Biology – Section 1 and Biology – Section 2 )

# But then I need a widget that can run permutations to determine 
# how to organize the classes in the daily schedule such that all 
# students can get the courses they need without any conflicts. 
# There could be 3-4 kids who can’t get what they need exactly 
# but we can schedule those kids manually. The widget just needs 
# to let us know who they are.

# See the attachments for a full understanding of what we have 
# and what we need. Let us know how you can help. It’s a small 
# school of only 120 kids but this process takes too long manually. 
# Looking for the lower prices.
